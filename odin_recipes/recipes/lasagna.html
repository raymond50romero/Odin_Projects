      Lasagna is a wide, flat sheet of pasta. Lasagna can refer to either the
      type of noodle or to the typical lasagna dish which is a dish made with
      several layers of lasagna sheets with sauce and other ingredients, such as
      meats and cheese, in between the lasagna noodles.

      <li>
        Step 2. Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven
        over medium heat until well browned.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 3. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water.
        Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt,
        Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about
        1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 4. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook
        lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and
        rinse with cold water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 5. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2
        tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
      </li>
      <li>Step 6. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Step 7. To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a
        9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce,
        overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top
        with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over
        mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 8. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan
        cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with
        cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 9. Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and
        bake for an additional 25 minutes.
